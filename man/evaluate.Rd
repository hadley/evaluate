\title{Evaluate input and return all details of evaluation.}
\usage{
  evaluate(input, envir = parent.frame(), enclos = NULL,
    debug = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{input}{input object to be parsed an evaluated.
  Maybe a string, file connection or function.}

  \item{envir}{environment in which to evaluate
  expressions}

  \item{enclos}{when \code{envir} is a list or data frame,
  this is treated as the parent environment to
  \code{envir}.}

  \item{debug}{if \code{TRUE}, displays information useful
  for debugging, including all output that evaluate
  captures}
}
\description{
  Compare to \code{\link{eval}}, \code{evaluate} captures
  all of the information necessary to recreate the output
  as if you had copied and pasted the code into a R
  terminal. It captures messages, warnings, errors and
  output, all correctly interleaved in the order in which
  they occured. It stores the final result, whether or not
  it should be visible, and the contents of the current
  graphics device.
